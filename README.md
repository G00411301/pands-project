There are a total of 150 instances of each variable included within the file.


My understanding of the project

My Objectives

I would like my script to be versitile in its application, as such I would like it to have the following features:
1. Be able to specify the file that the being analysed in order to allow me to repurpose the script for alternative data sets
2. 

Notes/Comments/Observations

The following section details the thought process/approach to developing the analysis.py file, I include also commentary on the
